### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jaryd. I work at [Harvest Profit](https://www.harvestprofit.com).

We build some pretty awesome tools for farmers - all to help them be more profitable. Besides the software, we have some tools like:

- [A Monte Carlo simulator](https://harvestprofit.github.io/monte-carlo/)
- [A Blend Calculator](https://harvestprofit.github.io/blend-calculator/)
- [An Agtech Sustainability Index](https://harvestprofit.github.io/agtech-sustainability-index/)

We've also got some experimental tools, like some [profitability zone mapping](https://maps-harvest-profit.now.sh/)
