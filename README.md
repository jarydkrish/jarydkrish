### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jaryd. I worked at [Harvest Profit](https://www.harvestprofit.com), which was acquired by [John Deere](https://www.deere.com/en/) in November of 2020.

We build some pretty awesome tools for farmers - all to help them be more profitable. Besides the software, we have some tools like:

- [A Monte Carlo simulator](https://harvestprofit.github.io/monte-carlo/)
- [A Blend Calculator](https://harvestprofit.github.io/blend-calculator/)
- [An Agtech Sustainability Index](https://harvestprofit.github.io/agtech-sustainability-index/)
